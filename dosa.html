    <li> Here is a complete Description of making <em><strong>DOSAI</strong> </em> tonight</li>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 3/4 cup Parboiled Rice (idli-dosa rice)
        </li>
        <li>3/4 cup Regular Rice</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Whole Urad Dal (without skin) or Split Urad Dal (black lentils)
        </li>
        <li>        1/4 teaspoon Fenugreek Seeds (methi dana)
        </li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon Chana Dal (gram lentils), optional</li>
        <li>Water, as needed</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Oil, for shallow frying</li>

        
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Have prepared batter ready or buy it from store</li>
        <li>Heat non-stick tava or iron tava (skillet or griddle) over medium flame. Sprinkle few drops of water on the surface. If water drops sizzle and evaporate within few seconds, tava is hot enough to cook. Apply 1/2-teaspoon oil on the griddle and spread it evenly with a spatula or a clean wet cloth. Take a ladle full of batter, pour it over the surface of tawa, swirl it as thin as possible in a spiral motion by rotating ladle and make it into round shape of approx. 7-8 inch diameter circle.
        </li>
        <li>Apply 1-teaspoon oil (or ghee / butter for crispy dosa) around the edges of dosa (or spread oil/ghee/butter evenly with brush for crispy dosa).
        </li>
        <li>Flip it and cook for a minute. If you are making thin dosa (as shown in the photo), you do not need to cook the other side. Transfer it to a plate. Wipe tava with clean wet cloth before making next dosa (this is to prevent dosa from sticking to Pan) and repeat the process from step-11 to step-13 for remaining batter. Hot and crispy plain dosa is ready.
        </li>
        

    </ol>
